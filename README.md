# Infra Alert
FIRST Girls and Allies STEMathon 2024
Best Project Award

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind InfraAlert stems from the need to improve urban infrastructure and create safer roads. We noticed that our city has many issues, from potholes to fallen signs to broken traffic lights, but the greatest issue we saw was the inefficiency of current reporting methods. Our team aimed to develop an app that leverages AI technology to address this issue. 

## What it does
InfraAlert is an app that utilizes AI to detect and report infrastructure issues like potholes, fallen streetlamps, and other road damage. It allows users to report these problems by submitting photos, which are then analyzed by the AI to identify and confirm the issues. 

Our main feature includes the use of the phone camera, where the driver would set up their phone on the car dashboard while driving. The app would then use AI to detect any problems on the road while the user is driving. The driver would be rewarded with money.

Our app tackles a multitude of issues:

1. Reduces the need for surveyors by employing everyday drivers.
2. Rewards the drivers, stimulating our economy and incentivizing the user.
3. Reduces the carbon emissions of road surveyors.

The app aims to reduce the need for manual patrols, decrease CO2 emissions, and expedite the repair process.

## How I built it
The app is built using AI technology trained with Google Teachable Machines to recognize road conditions. It integrates TensorFlow models to analyze user-submitted photos and detect infrastructure issues. The app also features a user-friendly interface where citizens can report problems, track ongoing repairs, and earn rewards for their contributions. The development involves coding for both the AI detection system and the app's user interface, ensuring seamless interaction and accurate reporting.

The app interface was built using React Native, multiple libraries, and Expo for deployment.

## Challenges I ran into
Some challenges include:

1. Finding many good quality training images for the AI model to accurately detect potholes and differentiate between various types of road damage.
2. Integrating the trained tensorflow model into the application.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am proud of creating a functional AI model capable of accurately detecting road damage. Successfully developing an app that not only reports issues but also engages the community and offers incentives for participation is a significant achievement.

## What I learned
I learned about the complexities of training AI models for real-world applications and the importance of user privacy and data security. They also gained insights into developing a community-focused app that incentivizes user engagement and contributes to environmental sustainability.

## What's next for Infra Alert
Future plans for InfraAlert include:

1. Expanding the app's coverage beyond Ontario to other regions in Canada, the US, and eventually globally.
2. Enhancing the AI's accuracy and capabilities through continuous learning and improvement.
3. Develop partnerships with city governments, environmental advocacy groups, and tech companies to secure funding and support.
4. Implementing additional features to further engage users and promote environmental sustainability, such as green energy initiatives and community challenges.

## Demo
The demo showcases the AI model's ability to detect road conditions and the app's user interface, where users can report issues, track repairs, and earn rewards. The video includes a tour of the app and a demonstration of the TensorFlow AI model in action.
